# R and SQL Demos
Some coding examples of using SQL Server database with R.  

Initially two simple [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) workflows showing ways to work with large database tables in R. These allow you to put data processing operations onto the database server without needing to know any SQL. This can speed up R processes and prevent out of memory errors when working with large datasets.  

This may be added to as more examples required in future.
